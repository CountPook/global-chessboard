## Key facts for building issues

- **Sections** are the styling primitive. ALL styling lives in `data-*` attrs on
  `<div class="node-section" ...>`; inline `style=""` on the section wrapper is
  dropped. A visible border needs both a width > 0 AND a color. Border widths,
  radii, padding, margin are integer px attrs (data-border-width-{top,right,bottom,left},
  data-border-{top-left,...}-radius, data-padding-{...}, data-margin-{...}).
  data-border-style = solid|dotted|dashed.
- **Inline text styling** uses `<span style="color:...; font-size:...; font-family:...; font-weight:...">`
  (textStyle mark). This DOES survive on inline spans inside paragraphs/headings.
- **Theme defaults** (light): paragraph #374151 / Inter 16px; h1/h2/h3 #111827
  Instrument Sans; link #0C4A6E. Because the brand is dark/navy, every content
  block must sit in a dark section with light-colored span text.
- **Headings**: <h2><span style="color:#c9a84c; font-size:1.1rem">...</span></h2>
  to force gold subheads (theme h2 is dark, would be invisible on navy).
- **Image**: <figure data-type="imageBlock" data-align="center" data-width="100%"
  data-src="..." data-alt="..." data-use-individual-border-radius="true"
  data-border-top-left-radius="4" ...><figcaption><span style="...">caption</span></figcaption></figure>
- **Button** (exact): <div class="node-button"><a data-type="button" href="..."
  data-alignment="center" data-size="normal" data-custom-background-color="#c9a84c"
  data-custom-text-color="#0d1b2a">Read More on Our Website</a></div>
- **Horizontal rule**: <div data-type="horizontalRule"><hr></div>
- **Columns** (2x2 = two columns blocks): <div data-type="columns" data-stack-on-mobile="true">
  <div data-type="column" data-position="0" data-width="50%">...</div>...</div>.
  A node-section card CAN be nested inside a column for per-cell card styling.
- **Ad block**: <div class="node-advertisementOpportunity" data-id="<offer_id>"
  data-advertisement-kind="primary"></div>. IMPORTANT: offer ids from
  list_ad_offers ROTATE between calls. Call list_ad_offers immediately before
  save_post and use the fresh id, or the save is rejected as "Unknown ad offer".
  data-advertisement-kind = primary (with logo) | secondary (no logo).
- **Direct sponsorship**: <div class="node-sponsorship" data-agreement-item-id="<uuid>"></div>
- **Merge tags**: {{current_date_full}} (date, "full" suffix), {{unsubscribe_url}},
  {{subscriber_preferences_url}}, {{first_name|there}} (with fallback).
- **recipients**: omit on save_post to default to free tier on web+email (matches
  this publication's audience).

## Ad-slot rules (learned 2026-11-12, issue #8)

- **One primary ad per post.** A post may contain only ONE advertisementOpportunity
  with data-advertisement-kind="primary" (the logo creative). Additional ad blocks
  must be data-advertisement-kind="secondary". Using two primaries fails with
  "No 'primary' ad slot is available in this post".
- **The ad network pre-accepts a daily batch of opportunities.** Call
  list_ad_opportunities (status defaults to active: accepted/pending/missed/canceled).
  The already-"accepted" ones with a send_by on the current cycle ARE the ads meant for
  today; embed those opportunity UUIDs directly (only "accepted" opportunities can be
  embedded). Do NOT try to claim fresh offers from list_ad_offers while the accepted
  batch fills the slots: claiming more fails with "can not accept any more opportunities".
  list_ad_offers' available_offers often belong to a LATER cycle (future send_by) and
  cannot be accepted until the current accepted batch is released/missed.
- **Timing caveat.** The accepted opportunities' send_by can be early-morning UTC
  (~10:26 UTC = pre-dawn PT), i.e. BEFORE an 8 AM PT (16:00 UTC) target send. The save
  still accepts them, but to actually earn the ad the issue should be sent within the
  ad window. Flag this in the handoff so the human schedules promptly.
- Ad slot payout ranking still applies when choosing among accepted opportunities.
